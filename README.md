## Architecture
The architecture is mostly based on ribot's Android architecture [here](https://github.com/ribot/android-boilerplate#architecture): 

![](https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/raw/master/architecture_guidelines/architecture_diagram.png)

The idea is to be able to compartmentalize every aspect of the project to small, chunkable pieces that can be unit-tested easily and without pain. Also, extending the project and introducing newbies to it should not be a chaotic task. The architecture does contain a fair amount of nuts and bolts but a competent learner would find that the architecture has a solid and stable structure that is easy to wrap one's head around after consulting this README, running the unit tests and trying to fork and extend the code.

The following should be familiar to those familiar with MVVM, MVC, or MVP architectures.

### UI: Activities, Presenters and MvpViews
The UI is a very straight-forward implementation of MVP architecture.

* _Activities_ is the one responsible for handling pretty much all initializations and UI interactions.
* There exists an object, called a _presenter_, for each activity instance and is specific to that activity. The  _presenter's_ main job is to simply handle all the non-UI related tasks, like fetching data from databases or calling APIs.
* Whatever comes data or callbacks that come back from whatever the _presenter_ did is piped back to the _activity_ through simple interface callbacks that that activity would implement. These interface callbacks are more-or-less a *contract* of what interactions that _activity_ can do. That interface is called in the project as _MvpViews_

To give an example:

* An _activity_ starts (`onCreate()` is called)
* a _presenter_ is initialized and called to go fetch stuff from an API or a database (it doesn't matter which in this level of analysis)
* The _presenter_ plays nice and talks to what would be explained later as a _DataManager_ to fetch the data from an API or a database. 
* The asyncronuous callback to that call would be handled by the _presenter_ which would do any necessary non-UI changes.
* If there are any UI changes, The _presenter_ would talk to the _activity_ through an _MvpView_ interface callback. Those UI changes could actually be many. In the case of a simple fetching of one quote and displaying it on the screen, there are at least 3 scenarios in which UI would be affected:
  * The quote shows up normally
  * The quote doesn't show up (server is not working or no connection is available)
  * The fetching process is faced with a big fat exception

Those are just simple scenarios. There could also be UI changes when the fetch process starts and ends. For example, it would display a progress loader when the fetch starts, and hides it when the fetch ends. As you can see, there are a lot of scenarios that a _presenter_ would need to take to the governing _activity_. All these cases constitute a *contract* between the _presenter_ and _activity_ which is detailed inside an _MvpView_ interface.

That's pretty much it. We have some input and output without worrying too much about who's doing what in the kitchen. It makes handling data and separating the tasks of UI and data much easier. 

The rest of the architecture would deal with how to handle the data using the _DataManager_

P.S: I primarily follow a *no-fragment all-activity* approach so I wouldn't have to worry about where to put the _presenter_ instance if I have one activity and five fragments, each requiring their own API calls.


### Data: The Overarching *DataManager*
_DataManager_ is a singleton class that handles all the necessary data operations whether its local or remote. 
By _Local_, I mean relating to an already existing database on the device. 
By _Remote_, I mean relating to an API or something that would require a network call

### Data: Local, Remote, and Models
I follow `ribot's` original separation of data and data handling to _Local_, _Remote_ and _Model_.

_Local_ refers to all the classes and things needed to handle an SQLite database. This project uses *SQLBrite* for handling databases with reactive extensions. There exists three classes in this category:

* _DatabaseHelper_ which handles any data-related tasks coming from _DataManager_
* _Db_ which simplifies the process of creating queries by having constant names and static functions to deal with cursors.
* _DbOpenHelper_ which is a boilerplate class that's used to create the database initially. I doubt there's a lot of innovation to be made in this class. Its a plain-old boilerplate.

The _Remote_ category contains Retrofit2 Services. There's nothing too special about making these particular Retrofit2 services that's any different from what the *Getting Started* page of RetroFit2 describes.

One interesting class which I add to this _Remote_ category is called _ServicesHelper_. The problem with RetroFit2 Services is that they are interfaces. I don't like to include logic in interfaces, even if Kotlin or Java 8 allows it to an extent. Sometimes, its helpful to handle the data coming from the API in a certain way and it would be necessary to have that behaviour abstracted to a class that can be mocked with Mockito. In the case of my project, I had a quotes API that gets a single quote only. I needed to a list of quotes to have an infinite scroller behaviour. Ideally, I'd ask the backend to make an extra endpoint that serves my needs, but that won't happen with a public API, so I had to make the API call multiple times and concatenate the result. Luckily, I'm using Rx which makes the job a lot easier. I used _ServicesHelper_ to write a piece of unit-tested and mockable logic that would serve multiple quotes instead of one.

### Data: Chaining observables and handling errors
So what I need to do to get quotes to show up on the screen is simple:
- Fetch quotes from database
- If database is empty (first launch), fetch quotes from API
- set the fetched quotes from API to the database

Here's how it looks like:

```kotlin
    //Inside RecordingPresenter.kt
    fun subscribeToDbToFetchQuotes() {
        d { "subscribeToDbToFetchQuotes(): " }

        checkViewAttached()
        mvpView?.showProgress()

        mCompositeDisposable.add(mDataManager.fetchQuotesFromDb()
                .subscribeOn(mSchedulerProvider.io())
                .observeOn(mSchedulerProvider.ui())
                .subscribe(Consumer<List<Quote>> {
                    d { "subscribeToDbToFetchQuotes(): Received quotes: ${it.size}" }
                    mvpView?.hideProgress()

                    if (it.isEmpty()) {
                        mvpView?.showEmpty()
                        return@Consumer
                    }

                    mvpView?.showQuotes(it)

                }, Consumer<Throwable> {
                    e(it, { "subscribeToDbToFetchQuotes(): Received error" })

                    mvpView?.hideProgress()
                    mvpView?.showError(it.message!!)
                }
                )
        )
    }

    //Inside RecordingPresenter.kt
    fun fetchQuotesFromApi(limit: Int) {
        //since subscribeToDbToFetchQuotes is subscribed to SqlBrite's SELECT statement,
        // whatever I push here would be updated there
        mDataManager.fetchQuotesFromApi(limit)
                .subscribeOn(mSchedulerProvider.io())
                .observeOn(mSchedulerProvider.ui())
                .onErrorResumeNext(Function { Observable.error<List<Quote>>(it) }) //OnErrorResumeNext and Observable.error() would propagate the error to the next level. So, whatever error occurs here, would get passed to onError() on the UI side
                .flatMap { t: List<Quote> ->
                    //Chain observable as such
                    mDataManager.setQuotesToDb(t).subscribe({}, { e { "setQuotesToDb() error occurred: ${it.localizedMessage}" } }, { d { "Done server set" } })
                    Observable.just(t)
                }
                .subscribeBy(
                        onNext = {},
                        onError = { mvpView?.showError("No internet connection") },
                        onComplete = { d { "onComplete(): done with fetching quotes from api" } }
                )
    }

    //Inside RecordingActivity.kt
    override fun showEmpty() {
        presenter.fetchQuotesFromApi(QUOTE_LIMIT_PER_PAGE)
    }
```
#### Quick explanation
* `SubscribeToDbToFetchQuotes()` handled subscription to Db. If the data coming back from the database is empty, then we would call `fetchQuotesFromApi()` from `showEmpty()` method.
* Inside `fetchQuotesFromApi()`, we try to fetch some data (quotes in this example) from an api with `mDataManager.fetchQuotesFromApi()`
* We subscribe the observable to do stuff on `.io()` thread and show results on `.ui()` thread.
* `onErrorResumeNext()` makes sure that whatever error we encounter from fetching data is caught in this method. I wanna terminate the entire chain when there is an error there, so I return an `Observable.error()`
* `.flatmap()` is the chaining part. I wanna be able to set whatever data I get from the API to my database. I'm not transforming the data I received using `.map()`, I'm simply doing _something else_ with that data **without** transforming it.
* I subscribe to the last chain of observables. If an error occurred with fetching data (first observable), it would be handled (in this case, propagated to the subscribed `onError()`) with `onErrorResumeNext()`
* I am very conscious that I'm subscribing to the DB observable (inside `flatmap()`). Any error that occurs through this observable will **NOT** be propagated to the last `subscribeBy()` methods, since it is handled inside the `subscribe()` method inside the `.flatmap()` chain.

### Handling Unit Tests
Whenever there was a need for `context`, I'd use *RobolectricTestRunner* as a jUnit test runner and supply `RuntimeEnvironment.application` as context.
The rest of the classes that don't require context wouldn't use a special runner.

In the case of an MVP structure, you'd need to unit test your _presenters_ and your _DataManager_ in terms of API and database fetching.

The process of testing is pretty straight-forward and nothing ground-breaking: for each test, *Prepare*, *Run* and *Assert*.

The *Preparation* process is mostly knowing what to mock and how to mock it. If it can't be mocked or you're finding this too hard, it might be a good idea to have another look in your architecture, maybe there's something you can abstract to make mocking easier. Testing always comes first.
Also very important to remember, NEVER create a mock of the class you're testing. You'll be defeating the entire point of it. If you're testing _DataManager_, create an instance of _DataManager_ with all the nuts and bolts it requires to be fully-functional just like it would be in the wild.

The *Run* process would mandate running the function to be tested.

The *Assert* process would check if the output matches what should happen to the input after running it through the function.

The *Preparation* step is mostly handled by Mockito. Mockito can even serve _RuntimeExceptions_ when accessing a specific function to test for failure. Its really great at that. 

The *Run* and *Assert* processes are beautifully handled by RxKotlin2 when data is involved. RxKotlin2 allows supplying a `TestObserver` instance that can be checked in the *Assert* step to verify if the *Run* step succeeded or failed. Here's an example test class from _DataManagerTest_ that tests fetching quotes

```
  @Test
  fun fetchQuotesFromDb() {
      //Prepare
      val quotes = DummyDataFactory.makeQuotes(2)
      whenever(mockDatabaseHelper.fetchQuotesFromDb(any<Int>()))
              .thenReturn(Observable.just(quotes))

      //Run
      val testObserver = TestObserver<List<Quote>>()
      dataManager.fetchQuotesFromDb(0).subscribe(testObserver)

      //Assert
      testObserver.assertNoErrors()
      testObserver.assertValue(quotes)
  }
```

### Handling Concurrency When Unit Testing
Unit testing would require running sequentially in an essentially blocking and single-threaded manner. One can argue that using a mechanism like *CountDownLatch* can allow multi-threaded unit-tests but I argue that simplicity is key and having all the unit tests run in a blocking and single-threaded manner is much easier and straight-forward.

RxKotlin2 allows the user to specify which thread to subscribe and observe on. I've made a small abstraction to this logic using the following two classes:

```
interface SchedulerProvider {
    fun ui(): Scheduler
    fun computation(): Scheduler
    fun trampoline(): Scheduler
    fun newThread(): Scheduler
    fun io(): Scheduler
}

class AppSchedulerProvider : SchedulerProvider {
    override fun ui(): Scheduler {
        return AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()
    }

    override fun computation(): Scheduler {
        return Schedulers.computation()
    }

    override fun trampoline(): Scheduler {
        return Schedulers.trampoline()
    }

    override fun newThread(): Scheduler {
        return Schedulers.newThread()
    }

    override fun io(): Scheduler {
        return Schedulers.io()
    }
}

class TestSchedulerProvider : SchedulerProvider {
    override fun ui(): Scheduler {
        return Schedulers.trampoline()
    }

    override fun computation(): Scheduler {
        return Schedulers.trampoline()
    }

    override fun trampoline(): Scheduler {
        return Schedulers.trampoline()
    }

    override fun newThread(): Scheduler {
        return Schedulers.trampoline()
    }

    override fun io(): Scheduler {
        return Schedulers.trampoline()
    }
}
```

I'll inject whatever instance of `SchedulerProvider` I'll need based on the situation. In the case of unit-tests, I'll inject an instance of `TestSchedulerProvider` and have all the threads lead to `trampoline()` which means its blocking and single-threaded and runs on the current thread. In the case of running real code, I'll inject an instance of `AppSchedulerProvider` which would run the threads based on which one is chosen without any changes. 
This abstraction effectively solves the concurrency problem of unit tests.
